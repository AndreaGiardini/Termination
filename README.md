Termination Game

# Build

```
npm i
npm run build
```

If you only want to play with mouse or with a gamepad controller, you can just open the index.html file on your browser.

You can optionally control the game with your smartphone by running

```
npm start
```

and opening a page to your computer on port 8080 on an IP that is available in your network. That will generate a QR code on the display that you can scan with your phone to turn your phone into a gun
